      First: Identify the factors 
Look at the multiplication problem.
Second: Choose which factor to halve and double
Decide which factor would be easier to work with if doubled or halved.
Third: Halve and Double
Halve one factor and double the other.
Fourth: Multiply the new factors
Multiply the resulting numbers.
Solution
The halving and doubling method simplifies multiplication by making numbers easier to multiply mentally.
There is a picture with the equations as an example.

    <p style="color: lightblue;">Generalization Multiplication Strategy
First: Breaking Numbers Into Parts

Break down one of the numbers into smaller parts.
Multiply each part separately.Add the results.
Example: 23×4=(20×4)+(3×4)=80+12=92
Doubling and Halving:
This technique is useful when multiplying by like 25, 50, or 125
Example:
16 × 25 can be halved (16 becomes 8) and the other number doubled (25 becomes 50), resulting in 8 × 50 = 400.
Explanation:
This is based on the fact that halving one factor and doubling the other doesn't change the final product.Use Arrays or Drawings

Show rows and columns to see the groups.
Example: 2x5   2 rows of 5 dots=10


Second:Use patterns

Use what you already know to find other facts.
Example:If 4 * 3 = 12,then 4 * 6 = 12 + 12 = 24


Third:Break numbers apart

Split big numbers to make it easier.
Example: 6 * 13 = {6x10}+{6x3}=60+18=78


Fourth:Explain with words

say How do you know the answer using math words
Example:”I broke searching into 10 and 3, then multiplied with by 6.”
